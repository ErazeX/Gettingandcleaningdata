## Getting and cleaning data readme file

There is only one script in the repo called "run_analysis.R"
In order to run the script the data file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip needs to be extracted into the R working directory.
The subfolder must be named as it is in the zip file ("UCI HAR Dataset")
Once the data is in the R working directory the script can be run. It will create an output file in the R Working directory called "Tidy Data Set.txt"
